The Testing methodology primarily consisted of driver functions for each version of a function file where possible however in cases such as the guesser function and the main wordle game function, testing was conducted manually and test case results were recorded as these could not be tested otherwise. (guesser and wordle need manual input from the user, and go into infinite loops if mishandled)
